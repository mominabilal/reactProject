# 🌟 React Interview Prep Components

This project is a collection of React components I built as part of my **DevWeekends Fellowship** interview preparation. Each component is designed to demonstrate core front-end concepts like **state management**, **DOM interactions**, and **responsive UI behavior**.

## ✨ Features

### 1. 🔽 Multi-Selection Accordion

A collapsible accordion that supports expanding multiple sections at once. Useful for FAQs and modular content.

### 2. 🖼️ Image Slider

A simple, responsive image slider with navigation controls and smooth transitions.

### 3. 🌳 Tree View Menu

A nested tree menu for displaying hierarchical data (e.g., file explorers or category trees). Includes expand/collapse functionality.

### 4. 🎨 Random Color Generator

Generates and displays a random color with a single click — updates background and shows hex value.

### 5. 🛒 Load More Products

Displays a paginated list of products with a “Load More” button to fetch and render additional items dynamically.

### 6. ⭐ Star Rating Component

Interactive star-based rating system that responds to **hover** and **click** events. Fully customizable and designed for review/feedback modules.
